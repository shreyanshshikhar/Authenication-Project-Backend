# Authenication-Project-Backend

 first backend project with login and registration features using Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose is an excellent way to develop a full-stack web application. Below is a detailed description of how to approach and implement this project.

 #Node.js and Express.js: These technologies will be the backbone of the server-side logic for handling HTTP requests and responses.

 #MongoDB: MongoDB will serve as the database for storing user information, including usernames and hashed passwords.

#Mongoose: Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, will simplify the interaction with the database.

#Bootstrap: Bootstrap will be used for front-end development to create an attractive and responsive user interface for registration and login forms.

# Along with that i also got to know about the need of Passports and strategies in authentication process..
